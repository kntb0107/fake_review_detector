Absolutely love this product!,"I suffer with dry sensitive skin and vaseline is one of very few products that doesn't make my skin flare up and itch like crazy!The first thing I noticed was the beautiful fresh smell that escaped as I lifted the cap, as I applied a drop to my skin I instantly felt a soothing relief and easily moisturised into my skin absorbing effortlessly and not at all greasy unlike alot of other moisturisers I've tried!

33,1/28/2019,5,Skin so soft.. highly recommend!,So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn\u2019t sure about the smell. It\u2019s not offensive it\u2019s like a cucumber smell (although it\u2019s aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn\u2019t feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up. Yes I will be continuing to use this thank you for a fab product trial and for introducing me to Vaseline Aloe! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],False

50,1/2/2019,5,Best Make-up remover product,"Have used a lot of make-up brands and in the past bought their more expensive make-up remover products, but none have ever removed mascara, eye-shadow, foundation bases etc as gently and as well as Simple Cleansing Lotion. Its consistency is not runny, you have to squeeze the bottle appropriately onto the cotton wool, which is ideal for controlling how much is dispensed. Also great for tidying up eyeliner or mascara errors when applied sparsely on a cotton wool bud. Always keep this now in my bathroom cabinet. Why pay more?",False

90,1/3/2019,5,Good if you have sensitive skin,"This is a good deodorant if you have easily irritated skin. It's like Dove soap in that it doesn't seem to irritate or dry out skin. I've used Dove soaps for quite a long time and this is certainly something which they are good for, this seems to be as good as all of them. It's main selling point, beyond being an effective 24 hour deodorant, is that it is not prone to marking your clothes. It certainly seems to work as far as that goes too, though we haven't been able to test on every single colour. Good though. Recommended.",False

119,1/6/2019,4,A good product,The cream is very easy to apply and feels extremly cooling. It doesnt dry with any kind of sticky feeling to it.

121,1/5/2019,4,"Smooth, clear skin","This cream is light, odourless and leaves the skin feeling genuinely smooth, supple and refreshed. I use it as part of my nightly routine - applying it when going to bed after washing and drying my face. It is light enough not to clog the pores or feel sticky on the face, and in the morning my face always feels smooth and replenished. I have also tried using this cream during the daytime and, while it has all the benefits described above, it\u2019s not long-lasting enough in terms of the hydration it gives, meaning you often feel the need to reapply after a few hours. All in all a great overnight moisturiser if you have sensitive skin - it\u2019s unscented and it\u2019s really gentle on sore patches. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False

128,1/5/2019,5,A perfect winter drink,"We all crave things that transport us back to more innocent times. For me Bovril is one of those things, from the gooey unctuousness of the tar black bovril overflowing from the spoon to the ""ding ding ding"" as I stir it in hot water to make it dissolve and the earthy, beefy smell with hints of celery and goodness knows what else. Sometimes you can get alcohol fatigue so Bovril is a great alternative to a nightcap or even mug of tea. I even go so far as to dissolve a pat of butter in it too for extra richness and within an hour I'm pretty much knocked out and sleep soundly until morning, warm and comforted. This pack will last me a long time I am sure, certainly 2 winters.",True

609,1/26/2019,5,Lovely gel moisturiser,"I do like the Simple brand products as I have sensitive skin and I need to be really careful with chemicals. This Simple Face Moisturiser moisturiser is fantastic. It has very little smell. It has a gel like consistency without the stickiness or gloopiness of some other products that are on the market. The moisturiser applies well to the skin and sinks in quickly leaving my skin feeling refreshed and moisturised with no heaviness or stickiness. I had no reaction to this moisturiser at all. I have a combination skin and this moisturiser was ideal as it has no greasiness. After a few hours of wearing I find that my skin feels totally normal, there is no greasiness at all which I sometimes get with creamy moisturisers. Also I found that I could apply makeup easily within a short period of time as the moisturiser sunk into my skin easily. I have light wrinkles and although the moisturiser can not perform miracles it did prevent my skin from drying over the day from the effects of heating or the sun. I think that this is one of the best moisturisers that I have used. It does the job with no side effects.",False

659,1/28/2019,5,Skin so soft.. highly recommend!,So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn't sure about the smell. It's not offensive it's like a cucumber smell (although it's aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn't feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up. Yes I will be continuing to use this thank you for a fab product trial and for introducing me to Vaseline Aloe! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],False

It soaks in fast, isn't greasy at all and has a really refreshing aloe scent as well. It does everything I need to and does it well. It's water based so probably not best for oily skin, but on my normal to dry it's doing great. I'm pretty sensitive too but this hasn't caused any problems. However, it also contains Palm Oil. Now, palm oil is a brilliant ingredient and does a lot of wonderful things. But at the moment, it's rarely ethically sourced and that's my only issue with this product.

899,2/5/2019,2,Formula change :(,"I've been using this moisturiser daily for 5+ years and it's always been great for the price. However a recent formula change means that it now stings slightly to apply, and has caused dermatitis to flare up around my eyes. I've compared the ingredients from before and think it's possibly due to the inclusion of 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol. Dissapoiting as was always super reliable before, even for my picky skin.

The size of the bottle is adequate for everyday use and regular use. And although the packaging is quite mild it does the job. I would definitely choose this shower gel out of the choice.

No one likes to have dirty smelly clothes and wash powder / tablets / capsules are a necessity that makes a hole in everyone's weekly grocery budget that could be better spent on something interesting such as cakes or exotic vegetables that you have to look up how to cook. Along with Ariel, Fairy and Bold, Persil is one of the big brands that dominant the market for detergents. It is owned by global consumer products giant Unilever who are experts at branding and marketing. It is refreshing to see these capsules at such reasonable value., they work out 15p each which is an absolute bargain. Even the dodgy imitation ones you find in sub prime supermarkets are more than these, and the great thing about Persil is that you can guarantee that the product is going to be high quality. These capsules come in a rubbery gossamer coated casing containing a different brightly coloured gel like liquids in each of the four compartments. And very funky they look too with purple, green, white and grey swirls of gu. These things wash your clothes nicely too and have a pleasant smell without being too overbearing. I have no idea what happens to the plasticated casing on the outside of the capsule after you put in in the washing machine. Maybe it bio-de-grades, maybe it disappears by magic, this is one of lives great mysteries like the Great Sphinx at Giza, the Bermuda Triangle or the meaning of the Voynich Manuscript.",True

At first my hair went dry and was like hay, then it was switching back and forth from dry to greasy but after a few weeks it's looking healthier than ever. I'm wondering if it just takes time for your hair to get used to less stuff on it and to get back to more of its natural form if you know what I mean.My main advice would be to try it for 6 weeks minimum before you write it off as rubbish.My only other annoyance aside from the price is that it's very thin and runny.

1800,4/24/2019,5,Comfort Intense Laundry Conditioner Liquid,"Our household normally use comfort, however I hadn't used the 'Fresh Sky' scent before, which I must say is really nice! Just don't go sniffing directly from the bottle as it's concentrated, the scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for a much smaller bottle and you don't need to use as much in the washing machine either (just half a lid worth); the smaller bottle of course makes the carbon footprint smaller; in addition, the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is a bonus, and both the bottle and lid can be recycled back. Only downside is the sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing the bottle in the recycling; hopefully they will work on making the whole thing recyclable in the future.

1951,4/24/2019,5,Great for sensitive skin,"My wife has extremely sensitive skin, which I never believed until I inadvertently washed some of her clothing in a different detergent. On that basis, she has used either Persil or Fairy products for our joint laundry for many years. Combine that with the fact that we cannot use biological products as we have a septic tank, this product is ideal. The detergent is dispensed into a capsule which is inserted into the main body of the product and then placed on top of the laundry. There is sufficient detergent for 48 washes from the two bottles. The detergent is complimented by a fabric conditioner, which is measured out into the fabric compartment softener on the washing machine; there is sufficient to condition 24 washes. Both products have a pleasant ""clean"" fragrance and leave clothing smelling fresh and soft after drying. A really good product for those with sensitive skin and competitively priced against normal supermarket prices.",False

1964,4/26/2019,4,Persil and Comfort Sensitive Kit,"In this ""kit"" for sensitive skin you get x2 Persil non-biological washing detergent (potentially 48 washes) and x1 ultra-concentrate Comfort Pure (potentially 38 washes). I say potentially because if you are doing larger loads you'll need to increase the amount you use. We tend to alternate between Fairy and Persil non-bio, not only because we have young children but also because some family members have sensitive skin. We've never had an issue with someone having a reaction due to Persil, it's probably our preferred brand. We don't use Comfort Pure all the time because some members of the family don't like how it leaves their clothes feeling (too soft!), but we do use it on the children's clothes because it leaves them nice and soft. Both products in this kit are endorsed by the British Skin Foundation. Price for the kit at the time of writing the review is £11, this is slightly more than you would currently get the individual products in some supermarkets (£3 for each product). But you are getting them delivered too. If you wanted to give a practical baby shower gift, this would be ideal, slightly different to a nappy pyramid. Would also make a practical house-warming present. Overall - good products that work, slightly on the expensive side.",False

Thought I would try this instead of my usual St.Tropez Gradual Tan the one you use in the shower. Well I am so glad I did as it not only gave me natural tan but also had a slight shimmer to it which made my legs look a lot healthier considering I am over 60 and it does not have that awful smell either like other fake tans.

The first time i put it on my arms all over sparingly i didnt really notice that much although there was definately something. Today i thought let me add a bit more after a my usual morning shower. I applied a bit more liberally over arms legs, and face. I have had comments today on what a lovely glow i have. It has developed nicely today. I have a sassy looking healthy bod and i feel good. Bought another tube and just ordered a few more whilst on offer. I hate sitting in the sun and burning (unless i am covered in P20 lotion) and this is a very safe way to get the bronze look.

They probably are if you slurp in what you reckon is a full measure and, in fact, it is nearer two full measures. This is a really quick way to use up a small 540 ml bottle.but.if you use the cap as a measure as it is supposed to be..then you will find it is a very economical way to use the conditioner! Very cool fragrance which actually carries through to your clothes, making you smell like a Fresh Sky  if you know what such a thing smells like? Something else I really like about this conditioner is that the bottles are all made from recyclable plastic and the manufacturer is asking for customers to recycle the new bottles so they can go the same path third time around! Three Stars for the product and another one for being good and green.",False
2107,4/23/2019,4,"Economical, softens clothes, not as good as dedicated fragrancers if you want a lasting scent","Great price for these bottles, and you only need a small amount (half a cap) in the wash to soften clothes. The smell is nice but doesn't last - if you want something that lingers, try Lenor Unstoppables (but that won't soften clothes). That said, the softening effect is noticeable, even when handwashing delicate underwear. I like the ultra concentration which reduces the size of the bottles for storage.",False
2108,4/23/2019,5,Convenient and effective fabric conditioner,This is an ultra concentrated fabric conditioner. I was initially surprised at how small the bottles were but then I read on the side that you only need half a cap of the product so each bottle will last you a while. It is nice to be able to fit the bottles in my kitchen cupboard! I did find that half a cap was enough. I live in an area with very hard water and my clothes came out of the wash feeling soft and smelling lovely.

2117,4/24/2019,5,Comfort Intense Laundry Conditioner Liquid (Fresh Sky),"Our household normally use comfort, however I hadn't used the 'Fresh Sky' scent before, which I must say is really nice! Just don't go sniffing directly from the bottle as it's concentrated, the scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for a much smaller bottle and you don't need to use as much in the washing machine either (just half a lid worth); the smaller bottle of course makes the carbon footprint smaller; in addition, the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is a bonus, and both the bottle and lid can be recycled back. Only downside is the sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing the bottle in the recycling; hopefully they will work on making the whole thing recyclable in the future. All in all, good value for money and great scent (though the latter is subjective).",False

2119,4/24/2019,5,Lovely scent,"This listing is for a pack of 8, concentrated fabric softeners, although I received a sample for review purposes. Note that the container is made from 100% recycled plastic and is suitable for further recycling, but you do need to remove the plastic wrap that holds the product information (once the bottle is used up, as you need it beforehand for dosing information). I found I needed to use a jar opener to remove the lid for the first time; I guess that is good when you are receiving this via the post as it means there is less chance of the lid coming loose and spilling contents into the parcel rather than onto your clothes. I like the scent, which transfers well to laundry and leaves it smelling floral without being overly sweet. It would be worth sniffing in a shop before committing to a large pack however, as not all laundry scents are to everyones taste. The softness is fantastic, particularly noticeable after laundry has been dried outside, which normally makes it feel stiff. A bottle will cover up to 36 loads (4-5 Kg), you will only manage 16 larger, 6-7 Kg loads. The bottle looks small, but the liquid is very concentrated, so do use the dosing cap rather than just pour into the machine as you will otherwise use too much (probably).",False

The bottle is small as the liquid is a condensed type and this bottle is capable of 36 washes (apparently), however, I would say that to get a really fragrance you do have to use a little more than it says on the bottle....however, that may be down to my taste to be honest as I do like my laundry to be very fragrant.

As a paying customer, however, these are nothing to write home about. There's an uncomfortable flavour clash, between the dark chocolate coating and the sickly sweet raspberry sauce which covers the core, that's difficult to describe. The core itself reminded me of the cheapest imaginable insipid, own brand raspberry ice-cream with little of the smooth creaminess you find in other Magnums. It's almost as if they rushed the product development process and ended up with bitter raspberry ripple on a stick. So, so disappointing when you consider what these could have been.",False

The scent is fresh, floral and pleasant, and not overpowering, and it lingers on washing well afterwards too. The bottles are reasonably good value as a little goes a long way - A half capful is recommended for washes of 4-5 kg, and a full capful for larger washes. There are 36 washes based on the half capful dose for 4-5kg loads, so as I usually do larger loads I should get approximately 18 washes per bottle.

The product is highly concentrated, so comes in a smaller bottle that is itself recycled. Reduced packaging and transport costs. All very commendable. Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, slightly zesty aroma to your clothes. The scent will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users).

When I say 'to smell fresh and pleasant' I don't mean stink the place out with the scent and overpower and wilt everything in a 100 yard radius. Again, fortunately, this doesn't do so and so gets a general thumbs up, but I could have done without the wording bigging up the wonderfulness of the smells.

I can't remember not using Persil non-biological as my laundry detergent of choice, it's the brand I grew up with - one that doesn't irritate the eczema and allergy prone skin of several members of my family. It has a pleasant, but not overly dominant scent, and the fluid formulation means this can be used even on cold washes. The Comfort is a highly concentrated version in quite a small bottle. In real life, the bottle is rather smaller than the product photo makes it appear in relation to the Persil, but this doesn't represent poor value (38 washes worth is 38 washes worth regardless of the size container in which it comes) and the small size does a good job of keeping the use of packaging materials down.",False

I really like the flip-top opening and how smoothly the product pours into the dispenser ball, which is much easier than the crosscut design on my usual brand that requires a fair amount of pressure. I never had a problem with how well Persil cleans, and this hasnt changed; a machine load of baby clothes  together with stains - muslins and bedding came out spotless. With the addition of the Comfort Pure conditioner, the laundry was very soft and smelled lovely. It also performs well on general washing. I have decided to go back to using Persil non-bio; not just for the frustration-free dispenser, but it performs so well and is kind to skin. Using it again has made me wonder why I ever left the brand in the first place.",False

The claim is it has 36 washes per bottle but that's using the recommended 1/2 cap, but I have to admit we've been using slightly more than that.

The product is highly concentrated, so comes in a smaller bottle that is itself recycled. Reduced packaging and transport costs. All very commendable. Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, attractively ""flowery"" aroma to your clothes. All scents will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users).

2317,5/9/2019,4,Sky fresh...,"I was a bit worried that a product called 'Intense' might leave an overpowering scent on your laundry, who wants to walk around smelling of fabric conditioner? Thankfully it's not like that at all and the scent it leaves is fresh and quite subtle (once dry) and lingers around without being too pervasive. The Fresh Sky fragrance is appealing and not too chemical-like with a fruity/floral mix. For me, it suits household items more than clothes, things like towels and bed linen are left softened and fresh-smelling. I appreciate the small bottle size and concentrated liquid and that it has less environmental impact but I do think that the concentrated liquids are less effective at softening than the more dilute liquids are. If you're looking for the best softening then consider a full-sized bottle but if you prefer a more subtle softening effect but the same fresh fragrance then this concentrated version is a great buy.",False

2335,4/27/2019,4,"Doesn't just soften and scent the wash, but the whole house smells fresh and clean!","I've not used a separate conditioner in years, because most washing products these days seem to do it all. I hadn't realised how much of a scent boost a separate fabric conditioner delivers, and how much it actually does soften the wash. The bottles - 6 of them, and not 8 as the ad states, come in a compact box and tbh, that itself could be used to deliver the products in, rather than having that placed in an Amazon box with more paper wrapping. All of the packaging, including the empty bottles, can be recycled. You don't waste any of the liquid, as the top of the bottle is well designed to minimise spillage and so that you can pour just what you need (half a capful is recommended, but I went with a little more), and not a gush of liquid from a large spout. I've had to dry indoors today due to the weather, and my whole house smells of this. I'm really impressed with this, and even for 6 bottles rather than the stated 8, this is good value for money. I also like that the small bottles mean that I can store them on a lower shelf for heavier items, rather than risking my under-sink shelving collapsing (yes, it's happened more than once!). Just don't squeeze the bottles hard, as they're made from recycled plastic and are a little flimsy-feeling.",False

2340,4/30/2019,4,Brings comfort to your clothes and your soul,"I love this product. It retains the quality one expects from the well known makers and leaves clothes feeling soft and smelling fresh. The concept of ultra concentrate isn't new as I recall they did one years ago in a tetra type pack. But now maybe public are ready for this innovation. The container is made from recycled plastic which is fantastic and refillable. It is also recyclable but the sleeve isn't which is a disappointment. I'm hoping the refill packs are from a more cardboard style pack though and fully recyclable. I'm glad it has a dose counter as it seems so much less to use it would be easy to put in too much if it wasn't there. My other half and I have sensitive skin and this was fine for us to use. I found it hard to read the small print on the wrapper even with magnification glass. But I couldn't see anything to say if it was tested on animals or if any animal products used in the making. Although this is not a food product these are issues that are important for many. Whilst it provides details of the headquarter offices it doesn't actually say where its produced, I think this would be helpful to know as for many people myself included would prefer to buy products made in country of sale to reduce carbon footprint. I am a little torn about this product as if it was a washing powder or liquid and comfort softener combination I can't help thinking that cuts down packaging and carbon footprint further and can be better value.

2430,4/29/2019,5,"Worked really well on my fine, dry hair.",My fine and a little over processed hair has long been a problem....extra body products dry it out and cause it to frizz while serums make it flat and lank. This is the first styling spray that hasn't done either and not only protects during drying but also gives a nice bounce to my style too.....wish I`d found this a long time ago! Highly recommend to anyone using heat styling their hair.,True

2442,4/27/2019,1,8hrs not 48hrs!,"I usually use secret, which is the best by a country mile out of many, many anti perspirants I've tried over many years. Added this to my pantry order just to get free delivery but wow its rubbish. 8hrs after using and I start feeling wet and sticky under the arms and that's after a fairly sedentary day! Can't recommend at all, one of the worst I've tried. One star for the lovely smell though, even if its a little strong for me. Back to Secret for me!",True

2446,5/11/2019,5,Nice shampoo- enough for at least 1 month,This is my 3rd time ordering this shampoo. It smells good and the content of the bottle is not too thick or too liquidy it feels like velvet actually. After I use it my hair feels softer which is why I chose this Shampoo for.,True

2462,4/29/2019,5,Works well,"Nice scent, large bottle which seems to be lasting a while based on the smallest dosage recommended. Clothes have a long lasting scent and are noticeably softer then when nothing is used. If the other marketing statements are to be believed, this is a worthwhile purchase.",True

2472,5/10/2019,5,Best fabric conditioner ever!,"There might be some more suitable for sensitive skin, but this is the only one that keeps the scent for such a long time. It even beats Lenor intense imho (which is also one of those that keep the scent for weeks!)",True

2483,5/1/2019,4,tasty,Taste fine.,False
2484,4/28/2019,1,salty,These melted easily into the sauce but was overly salty,False
2485,4/30/2019,2,Not the best,"I was disappointed with these. The size seemed small, the 'ice cream' was a funny texture, just melted in the mouth with no substance or flavour. The cone was delicious and crispy, although no chocolate in the bottom like the original cornetto""s. I wont be buying these again, I prefer the new Vegan Magnum.",False
2486,4/30/2019,3,animal testing,It would be good to point out that Cif does test on animals. Nope for me.,False
2487,5/18/2019,5,great substitute,"Will quite happily buy these instead of the usual Cornettos. The flavour is great, and the ice cream texture is different, but really good. The cone isn't quite as nice as classic Cornetto but still very tasty.",False
2488,5/12/2019,5,Lovely flavour,Myself and my grandchildren love these lollies. Unfortunately we all prefer the green ones so these go first. Would be even better if they sold packets with just the lime flavour.,False
2489,5/22/2019,5,A pleasant treat,Its been a while since I had the real thing and this is a welcome treat.,False
2490,5/24/2019,5,Favourite shower gel,"Love this shower gel, great for sensitive skin, pleasant fragrance and lathers up nicely.",False
2491,5/15/2019,1,Great cone. AWFUL ice cream,"Im a Coeliac and intolerant to cows milk, and have a huge sweet tooth. Ive found some amazing vegan ice cream alternatives. Ocado sell a number of delicious ones. I also LOVE Tescos gluten and dairy free Cornettos However was super excited to try these, especially after all the amazing reviews. The tops are covered in nuts and chocolate, and the cone is thick and crispy. However none of these bits are quite enough to hide the awful taste of the ice cream. I cant even describe it as bland, as it had a flavour.... just an awful one. It was not creamy and ice cream like. It was like frozen whipped up soya milk that they removed the flavour from. I enjoyed eating the chocolate and nut part and the cone, and just cringed my way through the ice cream part. Cant understand all the rave reviews. The vegan Magnums however are spot on and delicious!!!",False
2492,5/22/2019,1,Not as good as the ultra duo,"Very dissapointed in these capsules. The previous version, which was the Ultra, with only two compartments, was great because the capsules dissolved completely without leaving traces. These leave small white trails on dark clothes.",False
2493,5/1/2019,5,Best make up wipes,I find these wipes get my make up off easily and are far superior to other wipes for that alone,False
2494,5/19/2019,5,"Great taste, gluten free & vegan with no palm oil","Great taste, gluten free & vegan with no palm oil. Highly recommended.",False
2495,5/5/2019,4,It's no cookies and cream but a welcome yum treat,I was so excited to purchase this as I react to the usual dairy brands. The cone is lovely and the ice cream is nice enough to feel you are having a treat. It doesn't have the creamy feeling and texture of ice cream but near enough to eat and enjoy without any reaction! It's a little smaller than the full size cornetto but that's ok to keep the calories down. Would have liked the choc lump at the bottom of the cone. Already ordered my second box.,False
2496,4/27/2019,5,perfect,"These are amazing, just like the original Cornetto but vegan. Im really impressed.",False
2497,5/2/2019,5,delicious,Our whole family loves bovril and we use it daily on toast in the morning. My 2 year old loves it and always asks for it.,False
2498,5/5/2019,1,This review is for the squeezy bottle,Contents of this bottle is lovely. HOWEVER trying to get it out of the squeezy bottle is a challenge of strength and endurance. I will buy Helmann's light mayo again but NEVER in this bottle because I don't want to risk my bones and tendons breaking trying to get the contents out of the bottle.,False
2499,5/17/2019,4,very nice,These taste great and you cannot Cant tell they are vegan,False
2500,4/27/2019,5,Brilliant,"Really pleased to have vegan Cornettos at last, they're very close to the dairy version and I'm not gluten intolerant but the cone is great and you wouldn't know it's gluten free so I'm happy!",False
